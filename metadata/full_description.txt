Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and
Minecraft: Java Edition servers. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow
Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as
seamlessly as possible. Please note, this project is still a work in progress
and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!

This app requires an existing copy of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on any
platform. You need a paid copy of Minecraft: Java Edition to join online mode
Java servers.
